- 👋 Hi, I’m @victoriaburn
- 👀 I’m interested in Nature, gaming and sport
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python and Javascript
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Open source projects
- ⚡ Fun fact: One of the key principles of open source is transparency. The source code of open source projects is freely available for anyone to view, modify, and distribute. This transparency fosters trust among users and developers.
